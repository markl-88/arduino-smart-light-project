# \# Arduino Smart Light System

# 

# \## Overview

# This project is an Arduino-based smart light system that automatically adjusts lighting based on ambient brightness and motion.  

# It was created as part of my exploration into embedded systems and how thoughtful design can optimize efficiency, functionality, and scalability.

# 

# The system uses:

# \- Arduino Uno  

# \- LDR (light-dependent resistor) to measure ambient brightness  

# \- PIR motion sensor  

# \- Relay module + LED lamp   

# 

# The light turns on only when the environment is dark\*and motion is detected, ensuring energy efficiency.

# \## Motivation

# This project taught me how to balance simplicity with functionality, deciding when to optimize for performance versus compact design.  

# It also served as my entry point into thinking about low-power design and form-factor aware engineering, themes that connect directly to cutting-edge EE research such as MEMS integration.
